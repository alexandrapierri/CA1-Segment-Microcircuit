# CA1-segment-microcircuit
Code associeted with the Results of the paper:

This repository focuses on the simulations regarding the segment CA1 microcircuit, thus Figures 9-12 of the paper. 
Here I attach two matlab scripts and the .dat file for the execution of the scripts. 

Anyone who wishes to reproduce our findings should first study and familiarize themselves with the CA1 microcircuit study by Bezaire et al 2016 and the respective code repository.
