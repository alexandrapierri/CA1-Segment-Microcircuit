# CA1-segment-microcircuit
Code associeted with the paper: "Translating mechanisms from minimal to detailed models of CA1 hippocampal microcircuits,
reveals how theta rhythms emerge and how their frequencies are controlled."

This repository focuses on the simulations regarding the segment CA1 microcircuit, thus Figures 9-12 of the paper. 
Here I attach two matlab scripts and the .dat file for the execution of the scripts. 

Anyone who wishes to reproduce our findings should first study and familiarize themselves with the CA1 microcircuit study by Bezaire et al 2016 and the respective code repository.

1. heatmaps_gpyrpyr_gecca3pyr_stimulation.m:
This script reproduces the heatmpas of Figure 9B.

2. corrcoef_currents.m:
This script reproduces one of our main findings in the paper, of Figure 10C.
